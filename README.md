To run:

     https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1pYJnURrsegqkDVwvjTr7OigkEjcqz_Tb
2) Start running hash_map_visuals.py and max_heap_visuals.py.
   * Note: Each of these can be run individually. Just run the script and click the link given in the flask output.
   * To view everything together, follow next steps
3) Once both hash_map_visuals.py and max_heap_visuals.py are running in the backround, run main_visuals.py and click on the link in the flask output of that script. This will take you to a page where you can choose whether you want to look at the max heap visualization or the hash map visualization.


Note: this will run everything on your local machine, to change paths please reference line 421 in hash_map_visuals.py, line 402 in max_heap_visuals.py, and line 37 in main_visuals.py
